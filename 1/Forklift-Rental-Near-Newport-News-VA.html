<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

<p>The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. These are Class 5 forklifts. A reach fork truck is primarily an indoor forklift most useful for reaching high racks. It can be used in all types of workplaces where efficient material handling is desired.

You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover. If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Local Yale dealers provide service and support, just as they would standard lift trucks. Not every warehouse manager is ready to pay for rentals with cash.
