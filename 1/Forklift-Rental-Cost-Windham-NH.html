<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
