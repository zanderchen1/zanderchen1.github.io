Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
