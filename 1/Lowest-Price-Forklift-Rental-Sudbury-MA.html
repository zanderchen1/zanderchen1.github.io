Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>
<h2>Lift On Truck Sudbury</h2>
