<p>These developments constitute a dramatic departure from the norm, according to Brett Wood , chairman of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) and president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America.

<p>Sfikas said all car manufacturers want to know the people who are installing the kits and ensure they are doing so without tampering with the integrity of the vehicle.
