This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>

We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.
