If a lifted truck's front or rear bumper is 20 inches taller than a car bumper, we are looking at the truck's bumper clearing the car's hood and impacting the windshield.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
