<p>Workers need to be trained in proper load management before operating this forklift. Before you can spice up your life with a lifted ride, you likely are in need of some financial help. Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks.

Give us a call at 800-836-3882 if you have any questions or are interested in learning additional information about these trucks. Not all kits are created equal, and a rough-riding rig can add to fatigue on long trips, make controlling the vehicle exhausting, and put wear on the truck itself.</p>
