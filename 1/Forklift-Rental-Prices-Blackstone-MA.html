The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>

To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
