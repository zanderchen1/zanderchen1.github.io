<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory. On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>
