<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily. The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance. If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
