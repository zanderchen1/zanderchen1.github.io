<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
<p>This safety switch (which can be a pedal or other special safety harness) will prevent the the lift truck from moving unless activated by the operator. It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
