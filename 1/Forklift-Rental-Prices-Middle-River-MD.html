<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>

Winners of the FLTA ‘Archie' in Safety Excellence for the Pro 5 Series of Electric Trucks with its inbuilt Auto-Slow Down function.

For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking.

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.

You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
