<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites.

<p>A suspension lift kit will truly give you that monster truck feeling, as they can be raised as high as practically possible. Even with a solid 4% job growth for forklift operators expected between 2018 and 2028 , robotic forklifts are set to take over. Most rough-terrain forklift models have gasoline- or diesel-powered engines, but some models run on propane. Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast.</p>
