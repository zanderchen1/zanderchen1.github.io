A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads. The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load.
