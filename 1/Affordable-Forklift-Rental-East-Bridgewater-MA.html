Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>
