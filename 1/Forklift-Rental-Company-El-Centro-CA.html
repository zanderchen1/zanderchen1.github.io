<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. Stability - An order picker forklift must retain its stability even when picking goods at high elevations. Heavy duty design: 4mm steel plate fork frame and largerd lift piston ensure the truck to reach rated capacity. When you want the latest and greatest in forklift tech for your business, it's typically easier to rent than buy. These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs. The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>

The forklift experts at Northland Industrial Truck Co., better known throughout New England as NITCO , have hundreds of rental units on hand and are skilled at helping you figure out what options are right for your business.
