<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

<p>The outstanding performance of the hydrostatic transmission with the permanent 4WD Compen® or connectable 4WD FullGrip® allows the easy carry of loads on the toughest grounds and narrow places. Every forklift is tailored to the required needs of your operation, providing the right solution for your warehouse operation. Designed to push through the toughest work days, these forklifts offer dependable performance and rugged durability in heavy-duty outdoor applications.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
