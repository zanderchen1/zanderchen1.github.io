We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

<p>Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. ATTACHMENT: A device other than conventional forks or load backrest extension, mounted permanently or removably on the elevating mechanism of a truck for handling the load.
