<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires.

A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks.
