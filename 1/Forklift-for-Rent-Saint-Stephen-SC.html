It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
