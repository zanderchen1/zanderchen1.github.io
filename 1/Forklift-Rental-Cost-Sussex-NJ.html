<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Sign up today with FLC's comprehensive, OSHA compliant counterbalance forklift license training. Damage to both the forklift and load can be increased when the reach is extended while the truck is moving. We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. The most important part of parking lot safety for any vehicle, lifted or not, is being aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

If you're searching for forklift companies in Victoria and Melbourne that offer exceptional quality customer service as well as unparalleled machinery, Damoli is for you.

While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
