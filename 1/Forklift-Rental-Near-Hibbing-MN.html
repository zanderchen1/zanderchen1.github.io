<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.

<p>The telehandler is ideal for lifting loads off the ground to higher elevations. A hydraulic device with the capability of loading and unloading large stamping, bending or forming dies for industrial presses up to 400,000lbs.

The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment.
