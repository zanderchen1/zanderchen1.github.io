Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks.

We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one.

Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors. Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
