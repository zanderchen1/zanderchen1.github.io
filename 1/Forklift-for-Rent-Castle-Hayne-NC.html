The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Renting Forklifts in and Other Material Handling Equipment Castle Hayne NC 28429</h3>
<p>For more information on lift kits, contact us at Sour Lake Ford in Sour Lake, TX. We're here to make customizing your Ford truck as easy and painless as possible. This includes a Multimatic DSSV damping system on the off-road suspension, which allows for a smooth and surprisingly comfortable ride on even the roughest trails. It can lift a 4,000 ft payload up to 21 ft in the air.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
