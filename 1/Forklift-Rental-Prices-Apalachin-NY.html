This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
