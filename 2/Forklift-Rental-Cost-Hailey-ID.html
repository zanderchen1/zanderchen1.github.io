KION Group is the other major material handling company in Germany, and they have even stronger sales than Jungheinrich.

<p>The idea behind it is always the same: Every pallet truck from Linde should be able to be controlled effortlessly with only one hand.

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>Whether it's for a short-term job, a seasonal spike in business, or you're a small operation with limited resources; renting can be a perfect solution for you. Help lift and move pallets more easily with rugged pallet jacks from Grainger in the size, style and color of your choice. Forklifts have a stability triangle.
