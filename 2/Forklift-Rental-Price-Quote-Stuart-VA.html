<p>When comparing between electric and gas-fueled forklift types, the choice comes down to a warehouse's needs. Conversion training - This is for those who have experience with some type of forklift truck but wish to advance into other types.

<p>Its key ability is that it can extend its forks beyond the compartment and reach into warehouse racks in a way that standard forklifts cannot.
