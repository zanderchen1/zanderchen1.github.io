<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Telehandlers provide substantial lift heights over standard forklifts. Considering the materials handling industry's recent development in automation, real-time responsiveness and end-to-end efficiency are building communication between the management of forklift trucks and people who operate them.
