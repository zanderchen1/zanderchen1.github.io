<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Spinner knobs must not be attached to steering handwheels of trucks not originally equipped with such, without approval of of the safety department.

<p>Linde is constantly developing its order pickers, aiming to make working conditions even safer and more ergonomic for operators, which is why, for example, the latest generation of order picking devices feature an even lower entry height. Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work.
