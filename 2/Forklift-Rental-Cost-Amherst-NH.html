<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
