<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market. Rough terrain forklift operation requires the driver to be constantly aware of the ground surface conditions in the direction of movement, and requires focused attention at every phase of the task at hand. In such scenarios, Forklift Trucks play an important role in the food and beverage industry.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
