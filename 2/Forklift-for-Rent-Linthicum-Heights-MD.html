A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
