<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here.
