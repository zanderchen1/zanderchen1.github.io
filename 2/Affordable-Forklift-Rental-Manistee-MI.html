<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model.

<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028.

<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these extraordinary machines or perhaps looking to diversify your fleet, here are seven different categories of forklifts and a summary of how they are used.

JPEX 10 : Capacity of 1000 kg (Electric operated scissor hand pallet truck).</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty.

<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
