Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.

<p>These forklifts are much quieter, and because they are typically in a cleaner environment they will last much longer. We offer complete warehouse equipment solutions including warehouse design, warehouse storage, layout, conveyors, pallet rack, cantilever rack, dock equipment and repair, as well as scissor lift tables. The PTH hand pallet truck with powered scissor lift can be electrically raised to a maximum work height of 800 mm, avoiding unnecessary bending and heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
