<p>Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills. Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>

Rough terrain forklifts have achieved a broad level of adoption due to the mobility of the machines themselves. Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>
