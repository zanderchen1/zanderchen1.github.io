<h2>Important Considerations Before You Sign A Forklift Rental Agreement Corry </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Electric forklift trucks provide higher efficiency than the other forklift trucks, and also the components of this machine offer optimal productivity to all its applications. These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another. Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
