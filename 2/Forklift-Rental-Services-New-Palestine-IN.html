<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better.

Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>They offer a whole range of features that make them much more useful in a range of situations, so much so that they are often thought of as small cranes, rather than forklift trucks.
