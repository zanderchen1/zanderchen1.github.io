Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids.

<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
