<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>This ensures that each rough terrain forklift is compliant with all relevant regulations, standards and accreditations, ensuring user safety as well as operational durability.
