<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be.

Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck.
