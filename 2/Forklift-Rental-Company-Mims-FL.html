<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

If you have any other questions about counterbalance or reach forklifts or would like any advice regarding finding the ideal forklift for you, then please contact PHL today We offer support and have a huge range of stock to suit your every need.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>
