Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

<p>Firstly, a different training course is required for each type of forklift you wish to operate. Rough terrain pallet jacks 5 are designed specifically for use on uneven ground. Order-pickers and drivers of powered high-lift trucks face a variety of hazards that require training on compliant standards and practices, truck operational procedures, working surfaces and conditions, as well as fall protection training.</p>
<p>Still, gas forklifts are more popular for many outdoors jobs. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
