<h3>Boss Forklift Cary NC</h3>
<p>State plans are OSHA-approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA.

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
