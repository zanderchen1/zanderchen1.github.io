<p>Canada and Mexico are the largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers, according to ITA. The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

Forklifts built in countries like Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity of the truck.</p>

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>Forklifts For Sale - Representing the top brands with warranty and financing options. The Enforcer Rough Terrain Forklift range offers cost-effective options for moving and transporting heavy loads across rough, sloping or uneven terrain.
