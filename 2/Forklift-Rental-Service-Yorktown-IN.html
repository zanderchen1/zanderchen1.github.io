<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship. This Rough Terrain Forklift Train the Trainer course provides your employees with proper instruction techniques, so your trainer will be able to demonstrate and relay important procedures to the rest of your crews during future onsite trainings.</p>
