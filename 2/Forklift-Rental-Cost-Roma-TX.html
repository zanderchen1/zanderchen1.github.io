<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Telehandlers provide substantial lift heights over standard forklifts. Considering the materials handling industry's recent development in automation, real-time responsiveness and end-to-end efficiency are building communication between the management of forklift trucks and people who operate them.

<h2>The Evolution Of The Forklift Truck Roma </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
