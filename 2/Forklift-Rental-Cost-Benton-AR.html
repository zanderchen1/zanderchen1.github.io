Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines.

This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>

<h2>Pallet Jack Benton</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance. Industrial counterbalance forklifts can be used in a wide range of applications, like agricultural, beverage distribution and bottling, and retail industries.</p>
